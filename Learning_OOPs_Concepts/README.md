# Learning Object-Oriented Programming in Javascript

## | Procedural Programming

- Divides the program in a set of functions and data stored in a bunch of variables
- Procedural programming causes a lot of interdependency between the functions as our program grows.

## | Object-Oriented Programming

Object-Oriented Programming removes the interdependency between the functions by grouping related variables and functions in a unit which is an Object.

Variables in an object are called as Properties and function in an object is called as Methods

## | Four Pillers of Object-Oriented Programming

- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

### | Encapsulation

Grouping related variables and functions in an object is called Encapsulation.
Encapsulation also reduce the number of parameters of function by making them the properties of an object.

### | Abstraction

Abstraction make the interface of object simpler by hiding some of the complex methods and properties of an object.
Abstraction also reduce the impact of change as making a change in object methods will not impact the outside of the code.

### | Inheritance

Inheritance eliminate redundancy in code by inheriting properties and methods form parent object to child objects.

### | Polymorphism

Polymorphism gives the ability of performing different actions with the same function itself. This will help to get rid of a nasty switch or if-else statement.

## | Benefits of Object-Oriented Programming

- Reduce Complexity
- Reduce Redundancy
- Increase Reusability
- Isolate the impact of change
- Refactor ugly switch/case statement
